**Fraud Detection System for Banking Transactions**

**Project Aim - ** Build a real-time fraud detection system using machine learning to analyze and flag suspicious banking transactions.
Description: Create a microservices architecture to handle transaction data, with ML models for detecting fraudulent activities and alerting the bank’s fraud team.

**Objectives**
1. Develop microservices for transaction processing and ML model integration.
2. Train and deploy ML models for fraud detection.
3. Establish CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment and updates.
4. Implement robust security measures for data protection.
5. Set up real-time monitoring and alerting systems.

**Implementation Approach**

**Infrastructure Setup (IaaS & PaaS)**
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) – Deploy microservices for transaction processing and ML model integration.
 
**Microservices Development (PaaS)**
Azure API Management – Secure and manage API traffic for microservices.
 
**Machine Learning Model Deployment**
Azure Machine Learning (AML) – Train and deploy ML models.
MLflow (on AKS or Azure ML) – Model tracking and lifecycle management.
Azure Container Registry – Store Docker images for ML inference.
 
**Real-time Monitoring & Alerting**
Azure Monitor – Track system and model performance.
Azure Notification Hubs – Send alerts for flagged fraudulent transactions.
 
**Security Implementation**
Azure Active Directory (AAD) – Role-based access control (RBAC).
